# Problem-solve-with-Java

## What is Java?
**Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.**

## Why Java is highly used?

Java is widely used by developers due to its ease of programming and execution. It allows for the creation of applications that can run on a single device or be distributed across multiple devices within a network. The fact that Java code can be written once and run anywhere at any time is another significant factor contributing to its popularity.
